## Application Description

Requirements

Build an application using ReactJS (latest available version) which has the following
features:
• A component where you can search for images on flicker by keywords entered in
an input field -- DONE
• A component that renders the Flickr API results and shows a “save” button under
each photo -- DONE
• A notifications component that triggers a notification whenever a new photo is
saved -- DONE
• A component that shows all the saved photos — in a persistent matter. This
component should also be able to remove the photo from localStorage -- TODO

The saved photos can be saved within localStorage and can only be viewed by the
user who is accessing the application. The application should retain it’s state (i.e.
saved photos so one can view them later).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies for running this app from the package.json file. Run this command only once during setup.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.
